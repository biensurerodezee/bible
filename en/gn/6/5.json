"And GOD saw that the wickedness of man {was} great in the earth, and {that} every imagination of the thoughts of his heart {was} only evil continually. {every...: or, the whole imagination: the Hebrew word signifieth not only the imagination, but also the purposes and desires} {continually: Heb. every day}"
