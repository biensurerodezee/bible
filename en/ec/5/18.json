"Behold {that} which I have seen: {it is} good and comely {for one} to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it {is} his portion. {It is good...: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc} {all the days: Heb. the number of the days}"
