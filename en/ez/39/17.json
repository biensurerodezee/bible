"And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, {even} a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. {unto...: Heb. to the fowl of every wing} {my sacrifice: or, my slaughter}"
