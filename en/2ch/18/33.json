"And a {certain} man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. {at a venture: Heb. in his simplicity} {between...: Heb. between the joints and between the breastplate} {wounded: Heb. made sick}"
