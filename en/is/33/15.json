"He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; {righteously: Heb. in righteousnesses} {uprightly: Heb. uprightnesses} {oppressions: or, deceits} {blood: Heb. bloods}"
