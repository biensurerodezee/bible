"Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from {these things} that shall come upon thee. {astrologers: Heb. viewers of the heavens} {the monthly...: Heb. that give knowledge concerning the months}"
