"But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now {thou art} worth ten thousand of us: therefore now {it is} better that thou succour us out of the city. {care...: Heb. set their heart on us} {worth...: Heb. as ten thousand of us} {succour: Heb. be to succour or help}"
